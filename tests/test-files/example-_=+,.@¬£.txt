File used for testing URL encoding of special characters in file paths.

The file name avoids some special characters: 
* characters ":<>\/|?* are reserved in Windows file paths
* characters <>"|`!&() have special meanings in bash (which would complicate testing with bash scripts)
* ; causes 400 error when browsing to the file on bitbucket
